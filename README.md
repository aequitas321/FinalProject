### Lessons Learned
- One of the things that we learned is how to intgegrate Third-Party APIs into a web project. 
- The time it takes to build the feature or idea you have is about 10 times longer that you expect. There are always hidden obstacles and things you can't account for until you are deep in the design and implementation of the feature.
- Learned and experienced what it's like to bring a website, from conception to the background all the way to the front end. There are a lot of moving parts in a web application and if you aren't organized and careful it can get away from you real quick.
